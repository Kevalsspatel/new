						<p><strong>Traffic offenders gifted KRA Sh31.5b in 2018</strong></p>
						<p>Fines from traffic offences increased to Sh31.56 billion in the financial year 2017-18, as roads proved to be a considerable revenue source for the tax man.As Kenyans break for the Christmas and New Year celebrations,
							government entities led by the traffic police department are expected to arrest more traffic offenders,
							in a move that could boost the Kenya Revenue Authority tax base.
							Coming in the wake of continued missed targets by Times Tower which fell
							short by Sh76.8 billion.Tax targets

							This is against a target of Sh446.4 billion (equivalent to 4.6 per cent of GDP)- the taxman’s set target for the quarter in the current financial year, where he is tasked to collect an ambitious Sh1.97 trillion.

							“It is below target by Sh76.8 billion mainly due to shortfalls in other Income Tax, VAT, Imports and Excise Duty among other tax heads,” National Treasury says in its November quarterly economic and budgetary review.

							Last year, KRA saw the traffic revenues increase by Ksh7.4 billion, from Sh28.9 billion in a corresponding period in 2016-17 financial year.

						<p>An engine or motor is a machine designed to convert one form of energy into mechanical energy.[1][2] Heat engines burn a fuel to create heat which is then used to do work. Internal combustion engines are heat engines that burn fuel in a
							combustion chamber to extract work from the pressure of expanding gases. Electric motors convert electrical energy into mechanical motion; pneumatic motors use compressed air; and clockwork motors in wind-up toys use elastic energy. In
							biological systems, molecular motors, like myosins in muscles, use chemical energy to create forces and eventually motion.</p>
